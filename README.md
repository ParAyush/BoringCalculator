This calculator was made to be practice tool for calculus classes. I was commissioned to program a calculator that corresponded to the requirements of my clients university. Their university prohibited scientific calculators and my client didn't wish to carry a calculator day to day. Thus, this calculator was meant to be used as a chrome extension to mimick a real calculator to prepare for exams.
